#Probability Practice

### Part A. 
Given a single survey question to visitors to a particular website, what fraction of people who truthfully answered the question answered yes?      
There are two types of clickers: Random Clickers (RC), and Truthful Clickers (TC).     
There are two answers to the survey: yes and no.   
The expected fraction of Random Clickers (RC) is 0.3.     
The expected fraction of Truthful Clickers (TC) is 0.7.     
The probability that the Random Clickers (RC) selects yes is .5 and selects no is .5 as well.    
The results of the survey were such that 65% said Yes and 35% said No.     
```{r}
prob.yes = 0.65
prob.no = 0.35
prob.yes.given.RC = 0.5
prob.no.given.RC = 0.5
prob.TC = 0.7
prob.RC = 0.3
prob.yes.given.TC = (prob.yes - (prob.RC * prob.yes.given.RC))/prob.TC
prob.yes == prob.TC * prob.yes.given.TC + prob.RC * prob.yes.given.RC
prob.yes.given.TC
```
